# Waymarking Tweaks

This userscript shall make waymarking.com a bit more mobile-friendly.

## How to use

You need a mobile browser that supports extensions.

I am using [Kiwi Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser) on my android smartphone. [Flow Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.flow.browser) should also work.

[Firefox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox) only supports very few extensions and currently no userscript manager extension, so this will not work.

I don't know if there is a mobile browser with extension support for iOS.

If you have found a browser that supports extensions, install a userscript manager, e.g. the [TamperMonkey Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).

After that, **click [HERE](https://raw.github.com/MaxEtMoritz/WaymarkingTweaks/main/Waymarking%20Tweaks.user.js) to install** (from the browser with the userscript manager installed).

If this doesn't work, look for an option to install a userscript by URL and enter https://raw.github.com/MaxEtMoritz/WaymarkingTweaks/main/Waymarking%20Tweaks.user.js.
